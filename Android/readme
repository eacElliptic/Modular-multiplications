Here, there are two kinds of test. 
One using Andoid Debug class and dmtracedump to see results (code and results are in 'debug_and_dmtracedump' directory) and the other by using Java System.currentTimeMillis() method (code and results are in 'java_system' directory).

Some results from System.currentTimeMillis() are in the subdirectory 'trace' of 'java_system'.
Also, some results from Debug class are in the subdirectory 'trace' of 'debug_and_dmtracedump'.


The device we used for tests has these features:

Phone model: Wiko Cink Peax 2 
CPU model: MediaTek MT6589
Architecture: 4 * ARM Cortex-A7@1.21 GHz 
Number of cores: 4 
Clock speed: 497 MHz - 1.21 GHz
