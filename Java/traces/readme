For Java language, we used the profiler provided in NetBeans IDE 8.1
And JDK version was 1.7.0_79

With this profiler, we can choose the depth of call tree of the application to profile.

The directories d1 and d2 contain traces obtained with depth equal to 1 and 2 respectively.
In these directories, there are two types of files: nps and html.
- nps file is obtained when one saves a snapshot of profiler result.
- html file is obtained when one exportes profiler result, but this one doesn't provide as much detail as a nps file.

The file 'perf_mult_256_20_d7.nps' is profiler result after 2^20 modulars multiplications of 256 bits integers. 
It shows the complete call tree of these multiplications, the 'd7' means the profiling was done with 7 as depth of call tree.
'perf_mult_256_20_d7.pdf' is the corresponding pdf file, we made it to show the percentage of time of each method relative to its parent.


Also, the computer used has these features: 
- Model: Toshiba Satellite L50-B-1M2
- OS: Ubuntu gnome 15.10
- Processor: Intel Core i5-4210U CPU @ 1.70GHz Ã— 4
