This directory contains codes and results obtained by counting the number of clock cycles done for the modular multiplications.
In each subdirectory,
- bn_mult_cycles is for the openssl/crypto library.
- gmp_mult_cycles is for the gnu gmp library.

The results are the total number of clock cycles and its average number, for each size of integers, which is either 256, 358, 384, 512, 538 or 717.
Each trace file contains also the ratio of the average number of clock cycles between 256 and 358, 384 and 538, 512 and 717 respectively.

For these tests, we made 2^21 iterations.
