# Modular-multiplications
This repository contains performance tests for multiplication and modular reduction on large integers.
These tests were performed with the C language, Java and also on some Android devices.

From the name of each test file, the first number which is either 192, 256, 269, 358, 384, 512, 538 or 717 is the size of the integers used for the test and the second number which varies by language and the device used is the logarithm in base 2 of the number of iterations made in the test .
